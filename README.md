This is the first phase of implementing the airbnb clone projectwhich is the     Console. It implements the Commands for create, update, destroy, show and m    anage diferent classes and attributes for the items that the app will offer     and for the users.
  2 The command interpreter looks like a mini shell and allow us manage the obje    cts of our project:
  3
  4 Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
  5 Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
  6 Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
  7 Update attributes of an object
  8 Destroy an object
