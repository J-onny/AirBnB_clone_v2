This is the first phase of implementing the airbnb clone projectwhich is the Console. It implements the Commands for create, update, destroy, show and manage diferent classes and attributes for the items that the app will offer and for the users.
The command interpreter looks like a mini shell and allow us manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
